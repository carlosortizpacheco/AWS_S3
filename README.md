# AWS_S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service is cloud-based storage that can store an unlimited amount of data and retrieve thata data anytimie over the web.
Highly scalable, reliable, fast and cost-effective data storage built on Amazon's global infrastructure.

## Where's the data stored?

Data is stored in a region.
A region represents a general geographic area.
You choose a region for your data.
Currently 18 geographic regions.
A region contains availability zones.
An AZ is an isolated facility.
Data is replicated across 3 availability zones.
Amazon handles AZ replication.

## Key Concepts
S3 is object based storage (think object = file).
Objects are stored in buckets.
An object can be up to 5 TB.
No limit on bucket size or total data in your account.
Permissions can ve set on buckets an individual objects.
No hierarchy.
Files replicated across at least 3 availability zones.
S3 provides read-after-write consistency por PUTS of new objects.

## What makes up an object?
### Key
This is the name of the object (like a filename) and is used to retrieve the object.
### value
Any sequence of bytes you want to store.
### Version ID
A string generated by Amazon when you add an object to a bucket.
Together the key and version ID uniquely identify and object within a bucket.
### Metadata
Name-value pairs to store the information about the object.
System-meta data - creation data, size, storage, class ,etc.
User metadata - is custom meta data you add to an object.
### Sub resources 
Additional info such as ACL (owner) or torrent file.


## Storage Classes
Storage classes provide a way to select the most cost effective storage for your data basen on how frequently it is accessed an how quickly you need to retrieve it.

### Standar Storage -
Best when you need quick access, frequently.
### Standar Infrequent Access (IA) -
Use when you need data returned quickly, but not frequently asked.
Min 128K object size and min storage timeframe of 30 days.
### One Zone Infrequent Access (IA) -
Use when you have another copy or data can be re-created.
Cheaper but data is only replicated in one Availability Zone.
### Glacier -
Used for long term archive and backup.
Min timeframe 90 days, can take minutes to hours to retrieve.

## Pricing
Data transfer IN to S3 is free.
Data transfer OUT costs.
Pay for request (1000).
Pay for amount of data stored.
Per GB Pricing Generally goes down the more data you store.
Pricing differs across regions.
